    <!-- You can use comments to explain your code -->
    <p>This is a paragraph. Below we demonstrate how whitespace is treated in HTML.</p>

    <p>
        This sentence contains
        extra          spaces,
        new lines,
        and tabs. But
        HTML        collapses all
        whitespace        into a single space.

<!-- 
    Comments in HTML are useful for explaining code or temporarily disabling elements.
    Whitespace (spaces, tabs, new lines) is generally ignored by browsers, except in preformatted text.
    Use comments to make your code more readable and maintainable.
