    <h1>Paragraphs in HTML</h1>

    <p>This is a paragraph. It is used to write blocks of text. When a paragraph ends, the browser adds space below it automatically.</p>

    <p>This is another paragraph. Paragraphs are block-level elements and do not need manual line breaks unless required for poetry, addresses, or formatting.</p>

    <h2>Using Line Breaks</h2>

    <p>
        This is a sentence with a <br>
        manual line break in the middle.
    </p>

    <p>
        Line breaks using <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> do not create new paragraphs â€” just move to the next line.
    </p>

    <h2>Using Horizontal Rule</h2>

    <p>The line above and below this text is created using the <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> tag.</p>

<!-- 
    The <p> tag is used for paragraphs in HTML.
    Paragraphs are block-level elements and automatically add space below them.
    Use <br> for manual line breaks within a paragraph.
    The <hr> tag creates a horizontal rule, often used to separate content.
